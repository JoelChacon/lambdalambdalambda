Step 4 Connect to spreadsheet
==============================

The goal in this section is to take the last comment when an issue is closed (found in the last step) and put that into a google spreadsheet.

## Google spread sheet api
- Should just use the [get](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values/get) and [update](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values/update) commands
- Follow the links above to see node.js examples


TODO: Get example code working
There's some setup with the google sheets api that detail needs to be added.
